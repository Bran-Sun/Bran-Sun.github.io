Hi! I'm Zhenbo Sun(孙桢波), a PhD student of Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University(2020 Fall).

I have great interest in exploring the world of computer systems and architecture. I have broad interests including distributed systems, OS design and verification, compilers, and parallel algorithms. 

I joined the PACMAN(Parallel Architecture & Compiler technology of Mobile, Accelerated, and Networked systems) in Mar. 2019. My advisor was Prof. Wenguang Chen. I worked on distributed systems and parallel algorithms in the group.

Last Summer(2019), I worked as a summer intern in Carngie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Seth Goldstein. My project was about designing a scalable blockchain system with a hierarchical structure.

If you are interested, please refer to my CV or projects.
